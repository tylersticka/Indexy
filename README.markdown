Indexy - Themeable PHP Directory Listings

Installation
------------

**Proceed with caution!** Indexy is brand new and has not been extensively tested. It probably won't play nice co-existing with other scripts in the same directory that use .htaccess. It can also be a security risk to expose the contents of your server's directory.

1. Copy the indexy folder, .htaccess file and index.php into the root of your public directory tree.

2. Comment or un-comment any PHP5 lines in the .htaccess file to make sure your server turns on PHP5 for Indexy directories. If your server turns on PHP5 by default, you can comment all of those lines.

3. Edit your configuration options in indexy/config.php, especially the 'root_path' option if you're installing in a folder other than the root of your domain or subdomain.

4. Give it a spin!
